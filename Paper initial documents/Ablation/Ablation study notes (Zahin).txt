model 1- without degree
"The higher the degree, the more central the node is, but it is a crude one that does not recognize a difference between quantity and quality."

- popularity

model 2- without betweenness
"The betweenness centrality captures how much a given node is in-between others. The target node would have a high betweenness centrality if it appears in many shortest paths."

-crucial in connections

model 3- without eigenvector
"used to measure the level of influence of a node within a network. Each node within the network will be given a score or value: the higher the score the greater the level of influence within the network"

-influencial node 

model 4- without leverage
" a measure of the relationship between the degree of a given node  and the degree of each of its neighbors , averaged over all neighbors.  A positive leverage centrality means that this vertex has influence over its neighbors, where as a negative leverage centrality indicates that a vertex is being influenced by its neighbors. "

- position / status in a community: Is the node getting influenced or influencing? 

model 5- without lobby
" the ll-index carries more information about its neighbors than degree centrality. Also, it requires much less time to compute when compared with Eigenvector centrality. Results show that the ll-index produces better results than degree and Eigenvector centrality for ranking purposes."

-carries information about neighborhood i.e: community


model 6- without localbridge
" A bridging node is a node connecting densely connected components in a graph. The bridging coefficient of a node determines the extent how well the node is located between high degree nodes. It assesses the local bridging characteristics in the neighborhood"

-shows how important a node is in connecting cliques/communities

(optional) model 7- closeness/ authorities

why do ablation-
to find out if our results are equally reliable using fewer centralities
