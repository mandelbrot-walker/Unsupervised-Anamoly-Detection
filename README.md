# Unsupervised-Anamoly-Detection In Real World Networks
This was done as part of my senior design project during undergrad. This project aimed to cluster real-world networks such as Amazon, P2P, Enron, Twitch, etc., and find anomalies within them. In other words, identifying negative characteristics of untrustworthy networks like Enron thorough centralities and clustering.
