# Unsupervised-Anamoly-Detection In Real World Networks
This was done as pat of senior design project during my undergrads. The purpose of this project was to cluster real world networks such Amazon, P2P, Enron, Twich etc. and find find anamoly within them. In other words, identifying negative characteristics of untrustworthy networks like Enron thorough centralities and clustering.
